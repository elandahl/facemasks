So we had to fix some things, especially with the AB mask once we started rolling out production.
This is a summary:

In this repository are corrected PDF, DXF, and silhouette studio files for both the AB mask and the Froedtert mask.

There were several problems with the PDF of the AB mask pattern as it was currently available
(1) It was asymmetric. The left side was larger than the right, and the angles of the side pieces were different for the left and right sides. 
(2) It was sized incorrectly when imported into Silhouette, probably due to the translation of PDF -> DXF.
(3) The outer edges weren't continuous lines, making it difficult to differentiate lines to cut vs. mark within Silhouette. This was probably from the PDF conversion.
(4) Notches to line up and mark nose and chin darts were missing.
(5) Pleats and notches to line up fabric for pleats were off, so that when the pleating jig was folded the notches did not line up.
(6) The fold line down the center that Sarah suggested wasn't there, I added it.
(7) I put the grain line and Illinoisppe.org on them. :)


In the attached files these things are finally fixed. We hope!

We also made similar files for the Froedtert mask. They are in this repository as well.  
Note that the AB mask uses 4 times as much fabric per mask as the Froedtert mask.  It is also quite a bit more difficult to sew.
